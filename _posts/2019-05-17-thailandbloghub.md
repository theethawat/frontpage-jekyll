**Fail Projects**

## Motivation

Thailand blogger community in 2009-2012 we had **Thailand Blog Award** that it was a place that I and other people can share their own blog or website whatever get or not get prize from the award but the platfrom for voting blog can make blog had seen by many people. Thailand Blog Hub project in early 2018 was released to make it to be again.

## What make it fail ?

#### Bad Requirement Survey

Since I thinking about it I take a research for requirement only in one day with Google Form in My own Facebook and my Facebook page.I get only 4 answers that I think it only from my friends but I want to continues my work.It is the bad thing that make this to be fail project the research is not enough for making this project and I have not search on people who have a personal blog and how they promoting their blog.

#### Bad Grouping file and Grouping code

I'm only a student but I had learn about how to be a good software engineering something is about grouping, make program easy to read and inside program should have the smallest function. But in my program I use PHP language but I don't make any functions that is not good for good programing and I make all website file in only one directory.
.._ **Good things** Easy to write, Easy to connect to photo and Easy to connect CSS or anything.
.._ **Bad things** Hard to read and edit to me and other people and it can be lose data easily.

#### Beta Trying Using a lot of cost

I developed in XAMPP but I show beta site in the main URL that I must buy a domain and hosting so that it make some cost. In the good way you can show about beta site in your exsiting URL to save more cost and If your program is not wanted for everyone you will not lost money for free.

## Summary

This project make me know many things in PHP and a business thinking but it lost some money that not nessesory. If you want to make your own project use can trying in a visual server like me but you should talk to your friend or showing beta in your exsiting place it make your project can be possible.

This code you can study my own mistake or anything that you want to see but **This is a Bad Coding** and trying to don't do like me.
